\s Jesus heals a paralyzed man
\r (Mat. 9:1-8; Luke 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 After several days, Jesus returned to Capernaum. News of his return spread quickly through town,
\v 2 and many people came to hear Him teach.\f + \fr 2:2 \fk teach \ft Literally, "speak the word."\f* The house was packed and there wasn’t even room to stand near the front door.
\v 3 Meanwhile, four men came to Him carrying a paralyzed man on a mat.
\v 4 But because there was such a crowd, they weren’t able to carry him inside to Jesus. So they took him up to the flat roof of the house and made an opening right above where Jesus was. Then using the mat, they let the paralyzed man down in front of Jesus.
\v 5 Jesus could see that the men fully believed that he had power to heal the paralyzed man. Jesus said to the man lying before him, “Young man, I forgive your sins.\f + \fr 2:5 \fk I forgive your sins \ft This is a divine passive and can either be translated as in either present or past tense. It seems better to not use passive in English, because this helps the reader take Jesus' statement in the same way that his critics understood him in verses 6-7.\f*”
\p
\v 6 But there were some experts in the Law of Moses sitting there who inwardly grumbled when they heard Jesus say that, thinking,
\v 7 “He can't say that! Saying that amounts to insulting God! No one can forgive someone's sins except God Himself!”
\p
\v 8 Right away Jesus knew just what they were thinking, so he confronted them saying,, “So what's behind the way you are criticising me in your hearts right now?!
\v 9 In the case of this paralyzed man, I don't think you'll find it easy to accept anything I could say!\f + \fr 2:9 \fk In the case … \ft Literally Jesus used a rhetorical question, “Which is easier, to say …” Note that Jesus started speaking to them with the rhetorical question in verse 8, and added another one here. Neither question is meant to be answered. Here Jesus' questions function to both rebuke and teach. By asking “Which is easier to say,” he is of course not talking about the relative difficulty of pronouncing words, but of the kind of reaction that the words will have.\f* You're not happy that I told him, ‘I forgive your sins.’ It will be just as hard for you to accept if I say to him, ‘Get up, pick up your mat and go home’!
\v 10 But now, in order to prove to you that I, as the Son of Man,\f + \fr 2:10 \fk Son of Man \ft Jesus often spoke of himself “Son of Man.” This term, which Mark literally translates in Greek, really is an idiom from the Hebrew Old Testament. In Hebrew, ‘son of man’ means ‘normal human being’. Jesus called Himself that to remind his listeners about what the Prophet Daniel had witnessed in a vision of the King of Salvation. (Dan. 7:13-14) Daniel saw Jesus in heaven in the form of a ‘son of man’, meaning in the form of a ‘normal human being’, when God appointed him King over everything. Note that when Jesus speaks of himself in the third person in Greek, this translation will always make it clear that he is speaking about himself.\f* have the right to forgive people’s sins, hear this!” Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said,
\v 11 “Get up, pick up your mat, and go home!”
\v 12 And he got up! Then with everyone staring at him, he simply picked up his mat and left. Everyone was amazed, and they praised God saying, “We’ve never seen anything like this!”
\s Jesus calls a sinner: Matthew
\r (Mat. 9:9-13; Luke 5:27-32)
\p
\v 13-14 When Jesus was again on the shore of Lake Galilee, he attracted a large crowd. After teaching them, Jesus was walking away from there when he saw a government tax official sitting at his tax office.\f + \fr 2:14 \fk collect taxes \ft At this time, Israel had already been conquered and colonized by the kingdom of Rome. Jewish people who became tax collectors for the Roman government were considered traitors to their own people. They were also hated and considered sinners because they liked to collect more taxes than the actual amount due. (Luke 3:12-13) That is how tax collectors became so rich.\f* He was Matthew (who was also called Levi),\f + \fr 2:14 \fk Matthew/Levi \ft Mark wrote only “Levi.” His other name is given in the text because he is much better known today by that name, as he is called in Mat. 9:9-13 and 10:3.\f* the son of Alphaeus. As Jesus was passing, he said to him, “Follow me!” Matthew stood up and followed Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Later Jesus and his disciples were having dinner at Matthew’s house. Matthew’s fellow tax officials, and other people who were also considered to be sinners,\f + \fr 2:15 \fk also considered to be sinners \ft All tax collectors were considered to be sinners. See the footnote for verse 14.\f* were eating there. At that time, many such people often followed Jesus.
\v 16 But some experts in Moses' Law who were also members of the religious group called the Pharisees\f + \fr 2:16 \fk the religious group called the Pharisees \ft a group of Jews who maintained that all of Moses’ Law and all the commands added by the Jewish forefathers had to be strictly followed. They prided themselves in their devout devotion to all the Jewish Laws and traditions. Because of this, many of them didn’t like Jesus, because He didn’t join their group. And they were jealous because many people followed Him. Jesus rebuked the Pharisee group along with the Law experts in Mat. 23, because they just pretended to be good people.\f* noticed Jesus and his disciples eating with such people and weren't pleased. They said to his disciples, “How come your teacher eats with traitors and other low life?”
\p
\v 17 Jesus heard their complaint and said to them, “Healthy people don’t need to go to a doctor. Sick people do. I'm like a doctor. I came to call sinful people to repent, not to collect people who think they are righteous!”
\s Jesus answers a question about why His disciples don’t fast
\r (Mat. 9:14-17; Luke 5:33-39)
\p
\v 18 On another day, John the Baptist’s disciples were following the Jewish tradition of abstaining from eating.\f + \fr 2:18 \fk Jewish tradition … \ft The original instructions in the Torah say to “humble yourselves/deny yourselves” on certain high holy days like the Day of Atonement (Lev. 23:27, 29; 32), and the way the Jews did this was to abstain from eating. But devout Jewish Rabbis extended this practice to a regular fast on Tuesdays and Fridays. The original purpose of denying or humbling themselves before God was to express sorrow for sins and seek God's favor.\f* The sect of the Pharisees were also doing this. So some people came to Jesus and said, “John's disciples often abstain from eating. The Pharisees also do the same. Why don't your disciples?”
\p
\v 19-20 Jesus answered by giving this comparison, “The guests at a wedding feast would not be expected to abstain from eating, would they?! While the groom is still part of the celebration, that would be highly unlikely! But if enemies came in and killed the groom, then everyone in the wedding party would abstain from eating. Someday I will suddenly be taken away, and that’s the time when my disciples will mourn for me and abstain from eating.”
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus gave them two more comparisons: “No one is going to patch a big hole in an old shirt using a brand new piece of cloth. The next time the shirt was washed, the patch of new cloth would shrink and pull away from the old cloth, making an even bigger hole.
\v 22 Let’s also use new wine\f + \fr 2:22 \fk new wine \ft New grapes were pressed, then the grape juice was called new wine and it tasted sweet. New wine that was kept for a certain time would undergo the process of fermentation. The longer it was stored, the higher the alcohol content became. In Bible times, what was called ‘new wine’ might contain some alcohol, but not as high of a content as old wine.\f* as an example. New wine can’t be put into an old wineskin, because the gas given off by the new wine would not be able to escape from the old wineskin. The skin would burst open and spill all of the wine. New wine has to be put into new wineskins.”\f + \fr 2:22 \fk the old and the new \ft In these last two comparisons, Jesus compared something old with something new. This teaching was given in the context of him being asked about the Jewish forefathers’ tradition of fasting. Like new cloth and new wine, Jesus’ teaching cannot be completely harmonized with the old teaching of the forefathers. The same thing may be seen in the story that follows.\f*
\s Jesus is Lord over the Sabbath
\r (Mat. 12:1-8; Luke 6:1-5)
\p
\v 23 One Sabbath day, Jesus and his disciples were walking through a large wheat field. Because they were hungry, his disciples picked some stalks of wheat and ate the grains.
\v 24 Some Pharisees were with them and said to Jesus, “Look what your disciples are doing! They’re forbidden to do that on the Sabbath!”\f + \fr 2:24 \fk forbidden … \ft According to Deut. 23:25, what the disciples were doing is explicitly permitted on normal days, and it is hard to see how eating a few grains of wheat would break any law in the Torah concerning the Sabbath. So the opinion expressed would be based on Jewish tradition, not the Law.\f*
\p
\v 25 Jesus answered them, “You ought recall the story about David, when he and the men who were with him were in need and were hungry.
\v 26 David went to the Lord’s Tent and asked the high priest Abiathar for bread. David was given the sacred presentation bread that is always put in the Holy Place in the Lord’s Tent. Only the priests are permitted to eat that bread.\x + \xo 2:26 \xo Lev. 24:9; 1Sam. 21:1-6\x* But David and his men ate it, and in their situation no one considers what they did to be a sin.”
\p
\v 27 Then Jesus added, “God gave the command about the Sabbath day in order to benefit people, not to make people slaves of the Sabbath day!
\v 28 For that reason and since I am the Son of Man, my authority as Lord\f + \fr 2:28 \fk Son of Man … Lord \ft As the footnote in NET points out, the word ‘lord’ is in emphatic position in the Greek text. It is therefore rather astonishing that NET doesn't capitalize the word in either the footnote or in their text! This points to a translational problem: The original Greek text does not distinguish between capital and small letters. There was only one size of letter used at the time Mark wrote this. The word ‘kyrios’ didn't just mean the divine Lord, but also was used to refer to people like the English word ‘Sir’, and it could refer to a human owner, master, or boss. And the title of Son of Man which Jesus again used for himself here both revealed and concealed his identity, because it could be understood in the sense of an ordinary human, or as a reference pointing to Daniel 7. (See the footnote above for Mrk. 2:10.) So many people listening to Jesus would not have understood the basis for him being the ‘boss’ of the Sabbath. But others, and especially his disciples and some of his critics, would have understood exactly what Jesus was claiming about his authority. The use of capitals in this translation reflects how his disciples would have understood Jesus.\f* extends to what may or may not be done on the Sabbath.”
