\s John the Baptist prepares God’s people for Jesus’ coming
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
\p
\v 1-2 The following is the Good News\f + \fr 1:1 \fk Good News \ft This is the news that God has already made a way to forgive sinners so that they can live with Him forever. Good News is also often translated ‘Gospel’.\f* about Christ \f + \fr 1:1 \fk Christ \ft is a word from the Greek language, which means ‘the anointed One’. It is not a personal name. In Hebrew, the same term is called ‘Messiah’. During Old Testament times, each king was anointed with olive oil by a prophet as a sign of being chosen and confirmed by God. And all the priests and prophets of that time were also anointed. It’s appropriate to call Jesus “the anointed One,” because He holds the positions of prophet, High King, and our High Priest (Heb. 4-10). Because of some prophecies in the books of the prophets and the Psalms, at the time of Jesus, the Jewish people in general understood the meaning of ‘Christ’ as the King of Salvation whom God promised, who would come from the descendants of King David, free the people of Israel from those who opposed them, set up a government with the power of God, and rule with justice. (Is. 9:6-7; Gen. 3:15; Deut. 18:18-19; Mic. 5:2; Zec. 12:10-14; Mal. 3:1, 4:5-6; Ps. 2, 16, 22, 40, 110)\f* Jesus, God’s Son.\f + \fr 1:1 \fk God’s Son \ft Before Jesus was born on this earth, God had announced about Him in Ps. 2:7, “You are My Son. Today I proclaim that I am Your Father.” (See Heb. 1:5) Before the birth of Jesus, the angel Gabriel told Mary in Luke 1:35, “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of the Almighty will come upon you, so that the holy Son you will give birth to will be called God’s Son.” So God Himself was the one who announced that Jesus was His Son before He was born on this earth, and we call Him “God’s Son” in agreement with God’s Word. Luke 1:35 also makes it clear that Mary conceived Jesus— not because of a sexual relationship with God or man, but because of the power of the Holy Spirit. (See John 4:24.)\f* The story of his coming begins just like the Prophet Isaiah foretold. Isaiah wrote God's promise to His Son,
\q1 “Note this: Before I send You, I will send a messenger to get everything ready for You.”\x + \xo 1:1-2 \xt Mal. 3:1\x*
\q1
\v 3 His announcements will ring out from the wilderness,
\q2 “Let’s get prepared for the Lord’s coming! Prepare yourself to meet the Lord!”\x + \xo 1:3 \xt Is. 40:3 \xt from an old translation of the Greek language (LXX)\x*
\p
\v 4 After many years, the messenger that God promised came to the wilderness. His name was John. He preached to the people who came to him, “Stop sinning, so that God will forgive you! If you are sincere about following the Lord, let me baptize\f + \fr 1:4 \fk baptize \ft is a word that is borrowed directly from the Greek language. It means to dip or put something into water for a moment. Before John the Baptist began his ministry, there were already some Jewish groups doing baptism as a religious requirement or symbol to symbolize asking God to cleanse one of sin and desire to live without sin. For we Christians, baptism has the same meaning, but is given a new meaning in greater depth. First, baptism is a sign the we have decided to follow Jesus for as long as we live. Because Jesus has already cleansed us from sin, baptism also shows that we will continue to live free from sin and according to the will of God. And the deeper meaning of baptism is that in a spiritual sense, we have been buried with Jesus and already have been brought back to life with Jesus. It means that we now live a new life. See Acts 2:38; Rom. 6:3-4; Gal. 3:26-28; Col. 2:12-13.\f* you.”
\v 5 It seemed like everyone from the whole province of Judea and from Jerusalem came out to the Jordan River to listen to John. They confessed their sins to God, and John baptized them there.
\v 6 John’s lifestyle marked him as a prophet. He wore rough clothes made of camel’s hair
\p with a leather belt around his waist, and he often ate locusts and wild honey.
\p
\v 7 He also taught them, “Soon One with far greater authority than me will come. I’m not even worthy to be the slave who would stoop down to untie the straps of his sandals.\f + \fr 1:7 \fk His sandals \ft During Jesus’ time, everyone wore sandals that were made from animal skin, and it was very easy for their feet to get dirty when walking. Because of that, when a guest entered a house, a slave or a servant usually had the task of untying the straps of the sandals and washing the guest’s feet. So what Mark writes here, “to stoop down and untie the straps of His sandals,” illustrates that John doesn’t feel worthy to take the job of a slave who does the most lowly work, like washing the guests’ feet.\f*
\v 8 I can only baptize you with water, but that One will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
\s John baptizes Jesus
\p
\v 9 During that time, Jesus (who was from the town of Nazareth in Galilee) came and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
\v 10 The moment Jesus came out of the water he saw heaven split apart. As he watched, God’s Spirit descended on Him in the form of a dove.
\v 11 And everyone there heard God speak to him, “You are my Son. I love you and you please me so much!”
\s Jesus is tempted by the devil
\r (Mat. 4:1-11; Luke 4:1-13)
\p
\v 12 Right after that, God’s Spirit compelled Jesus to go out alone into the wilderness.
\v 13 Jesus wandered out there for forty days— out where there are many wild animals. Satan repeatedly tempted Him without success. Angels also came and helped Jesus.
\s Jesus begins His work
\r (Mat. 4:12-22; Luke 4:14-15, 5:1-11)
\p
\v 14 After John the Baptist was thrown in jail, Jesus went around the province of Galilee preaching the Good News of God.
\v 15 His message was, “It is time for God to set up His kingdom. Repent and believe this good news!”
\p
\v 16 While Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee, he saw two fishermen throwing their nets into the lake. They were Simon (who was also called Peter) and his younger brother Andrew.
\v 17 Then Jesus said to them, “Come and follow Me. Instead of netting fish, I’ll teach you to net and lead people.”
\v 18 At that very moment, they left their nets and followed Jesus.
\v 19-20 Jesus walked a little farther on and saw two other fishermen mending their nets in a boat. They were James and his younger brother, John, the sons of Zebedee. As soon as Jesus saw them, he called them. And they left their father and his hired men, and followed Jesus.
\s Jesus drives an evil spirit out of a man at Capernaum
\p
\v 21 After that, Jesus and his disciples went to the city of Capernaum. On the Sabbath day, he entered the Jewish meeting house\f + \fr 1:21 \fk Jewish meeting house \ft In the Greek language the word is synagogue. In New Testament times, synagogues were used for all kinds of civic meetings and decision making, and were also used as places for Jewish people to pray and study God’s Word. Meeting houses were different than the temple in the city of Jerusalem. Animal sacrifices and other offerings were never performed at synagogues, but only at the altar of the temple.\f* and taught the people there.
\v 22 They were amazed at his teaching, because his words carried such personal authority. Unlike the experts in Jewish Law, he didn't just borrow authority by quoting what other teachers had said.
\p
\v 23 Then suddenly a man who was controlled by an evil spirit came in and shouted,
\v 24 “Hey, you\f + \fr 1:24 \fk you \ft Since at least the 1950-60's, Bible translations stopped following the KJV's method of using capital letters for pronouns referring to deity. A capital letter can only be seen by a reader, but cannot be heard by one who is only listening to a reading. The identity (referent) of each pronoun must therefore be clear without the use of capital letters. Another reason for not using capital letters is that some readers wrongly thought that any speaker in the New Testament who used a capital letter pronoun referring to Jesus was a believer in him. Many who spoke about Jesus were not believers. Here we have a demon who actually believed something about Jesus, but his words should not be understood to convey respect for Jesus.\f* from Nazareth— Jesus, why come stick your nose in here! Are you gonna wipe us out?! I know who you are! You’re the holy one sent from God!”
\v 25 Jesus commanded, “Shut up! Come out of that man!”
\v 26 The man screamed as the evil spirit shook him violently, and then the evil spirit was gone.
\v 27 Everyone there was totally amazed. This caused them to ask each other, “Wow! What kind of a new teaching is this?! This man's authority is so great that even evil spirits obey Him!”
\v 28 Then news about Jesus spread rapidly throughout the whole province of Galilee.
\s Jesus heals many people
\r (Mat. 8:14-17; Luke 4:38-41)
\p
\v 29 When Jesus and his four disciples left the synagogue, they immediately entered Peter and Andrew’s house. (So James and John were there too.)
\v 30 Right away someone told Jesus that Peter's mother-in-law was in bed because she was sick with a fever.
\v 31 Jesus went to her, took her hand, and helped her to sit up. At that very moment, her fever disappeared. Then she got up and served them a meal.\f + \fr 1:32 \fk served them a meal \ft This meal would have consisted of food prepared before the Sabbath began. On the Sabbath Day the Law forbid her from lighting a fire or cooking.\f*
\v 32 That evening after sunset,\f + \fr 1:32 \fk 1:32 \ft it was almost dark \ft The Sabbath Day for the Jews started when the sun set on Friday, and ended when the sun set on Saturday. So the residents of that city waited until the Sabbath Day had ended to bring sick people to Jesus.\f* the people of the town brought to Jesus everyone who was sick and those oppressed by demons.
\v 33 And it seemed like all the people of Capernaum had gathered in front of Peter and Andrew’s house.
\v 34 Jesus healed so many people, no matter what sort of sickness they had! He also drove out demons who were oppressing people. He didn’t allow the demons to speak, because they knew who He really was.\f + \fr 1:34 \fk knew who He really was \ft This doesn’t mean that they knew His name was Jesus, but just like what happened in Mark 5:7, the demons shouted, “You’re God’s Son.” So it’s obvious that the demons already knew Jesus’ relationship to God. But Jesus did not want the testimony of demons.\f*
\s Jesus tells the Good News in the province of Galilee
\r (Luke 4:42-44)
\p
\v 35 The next morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the town, and went out to a lonely place to pray.
\v 36 When Peter and his friends saw that Jesus wasn’t in the house, they went out to search for Him.
\v 37 When they found Him they said, “Let’s go back to town. Everyone’s looking for you.”
\p
\v 38 But He answered, “No. Instead let's go to the other villages in this region, so that I can teach the Good News there too, because that’s the reason I'm here.”
\v 39 So He went everywhere in the province of Galilee and taught in their meeting houses. He also expelled many demons from people.
\s Jesus heals a man with a contagious skin disease
\r (Mat. 8:1-4; Luke 5:12-16)
\p
\v 40 At that time a man suffering from a contagious skin disease\f + \fr 1:40 \fk a contagious skin disease \ft The skin disease that was meant here wasn’t the same as what’s called “leprosy” now. According to the Law, people suffering with such a skin disease were considered unclean. They couldn’t come near healthy people, they couldn’t enter the Jewish meeting houses, and they had to live outside the village or city. (See Lev. 13.)\f* came, knelt down in front of Jesus and said, “Sir, I know you have the power to heal me if you want to.”
\p
\v 41 Moved with compassion for him, Jesus reached out and touched him\f + \fr 1:41 \fk touched \ft Because of the rules in the Law about people suffering with contagious skin diseases, healthy people seldom touched them or were touched by them. But in this verse Jesus touches this sick man, because He knew, of course, that the man would be healed.\f* while saying, “I do want to. Be healed!”
\v 42 At that very moment, the man's skin disease disappeared and he was healed!
\p
\v 43 Right away Jesus sent him away with this stern warning,
\v 44 “Don’t tell anyone about what just happened to you! Go first to one of the priests and have him examine you. Then give the offering for the cleansing ceremony that Moses commanded for anyone healed from a skin disease.\f + \fr 1:44 \fk Moses commanded … skin disease \ft The ceremony that Moses wrote for cleansing from skin diseases is found in Lev. 14:1-32. If a priest agreed that the person was healed, that person had to bring two living birds to God’s House so that the priests could perform the ceremony of purification from the skin disease. One bird was cut above a dish that was filled with water, so that its blood mixed with the water. Then the person was sprinkled with that blood mixture. (And the bird’s carcass may have been burned on the Lord’s altar.) The second bird was dipped in the water mixed with blood and set free. In this story, Jesus meant that the man who was healed had to go to God’s House in Jerusalem, because offerings like this weren’t done in the local synagogues.\f* In that way, everyone will know that you are truly healed.”
\p
\v 45 But as soon as the man left him, he began openly telling everyone about his healing. Consequently, after that it became impractical for Jesus to be recognized in any town. He and his disciples stayed in lonely wilderness places. But people still came to him from everywhere.
